# week-6-weather-app-challenge
Building a weather app from the ground up using HTML, CSS, JS, 3rd Party APIs, and OpenWeatherMap API

The purpose of this project is to learn to use server side APIs to access data to create a 5 Day Forecast weather app that will also store the cities you've searched for in previous sessions.

The "Get Next Hour" function was written with the help of my instructor Josh Naylor.

Portions of this code were worked out with Brooke Love during office hours on Monday July 17th, 2023.
